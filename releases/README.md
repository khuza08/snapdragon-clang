# Information

This is the release of Snapdragon LLVM ARM C/C++ compiler toolchain version 19.0.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler will generate code for ARM and X86 targets and will not generate code for any of the other targets supported by the llvm.org compiler.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM 19.0 toolchain includes all changes in the llvm.org 19.1 release branch, and proprietary features and optimizations that are not available in the llvm.org 19.1 branch.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler uses the integrated assembler for assembling and includes a full featured proprietary linker (QC Linker) for linking.
